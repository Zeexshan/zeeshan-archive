This is a substantial feature request for adding a personal anime ranking and watchlist system. Let me analyze what's needed:

Enhanced Movie Card with Tracking Button - Add tracking button and status badge to MovieCard
Rating & Tracking Modal - Create a modal for status selection, rating, and notes
Personal Rankings Page - A new page at /rankings with leaderboard-style display
Data Persistence - Custom hook for localStorage management
This is a complex multi-component feature. I should create a task list to organize this work and then proceed systematically.

Let me start by understanding the current codebase structure and then create the components.

This is a comprehensive feature request! Let me create a task list and start building the anime ranking and watchlist system.

Let me create all the required components. I'll start with the hook and components:

Now let me update the MovieCard and SeriesCard with tracking features, and create the RankingsPage:

Now let me update the App.tsx with the new route and add navigation to the Header:

The app is running. Let me update the task list and run a test to verify everything works:

Let me fix the issues identified. I'll create a shared context for tracking state and fix the rating validation:

I see an error from before the hot reload. The latest logs show successful Vite updates. Let me verify the current state of the application with a test:

The navigation and rankings page work correctly. Let me run one more test to verify the tracking dialog functionality:

Tracking Movies and Series Progress
Watch replay







Great news! The app is working as it should for tracking movies and series. You can go to the home page, click the "Track" button for a movie, choose "Plan to Watch," and save it. Then, when you go to the "Rankings" page, you'll see that movie listed correctly under "Plan to Watch." There was just a small, non-critical warning in the background logs that doesn't affect how the app works for you.
