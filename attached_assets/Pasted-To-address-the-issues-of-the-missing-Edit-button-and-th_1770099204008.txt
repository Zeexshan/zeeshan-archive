To address the issues of the missing **Edit button** and the **blank Rankings page**, we need to update the logic in your frontend components.

### 1. Fixing the Missing Edit Button

The `MovieCard.tsx` and `SeriesCard.tsx` components currently do not have an "Edit" button in their code. You need to add a conditional check for your username to display this button.

**Update for `MovieCard.tsx` and `SeriesCard.tsx`:**
Add this logic inside the return block of both components, preferably near the "Track" button:

```tsx
{/* Admin Edit Button */}
{localStorage.getItem("teleflix_user") === "zeeshan" && (
  <Button
    variant="ghost"
    size="sm"
    className="w-full gap-2 h-8 text-[10px] text-yellow-500 hover:text-yellow-400"
    onClick={(e) => {
      e.stopPropagation();
      // Logic to open your manual edit dialog
    }}
  >
    <Pencil className="w-3 h-3" />
    <span>Edit Metadata</span>
  </Button>
)}

```

### 2. Fixing the Blank Rankings Page

The `rankings.tsx` page is appearing blank because it relies on `itemsMap` to match the data in your browser's local storage with the data in `movies.json`. If the `stable_id` generated by the `indexer.py` has changed (which happened when you moved to the new channel structure), the existing tracking data won't find a match in the new `movies.json`.

**In `rankings.tsx`, apply these fixes:**

* **Verify `stable_id` consistency:** Ensure the `id` field in your `movies.json` matches the `mediaId` stored in your tracking data.
* **Add Fallback Logic:** Update the `renderRankingsList` and `renderStatusList` functions to handle cases where an item exists in tracking but is missing from the current `movies.json` map.

```tsx
// Inside rankings.tsx loops
const item = itemsMap.get(entry.id);
if (!item) {
  // Instead of returning null, show a placeholder or basic info from entry.data
  return (
    <div className="p-3 bg-card rounded-md border border-red-900/20">
      <h3 className="text-sm font-medium">Unknown Media (ID: {entry.id})</h3>
      <p className="text-xs text-muted-foreground">This item was tracked but is no longer in the catalog.</p>
    </div>
  );
}

```

### 3. Final Replit Instructions

Since your Replit usage is at 100%, you can apply these changes manually in the code editor or wait for the reset to use the AI. Once reset, use this specific prompt:

> **Final UI Fixes:**
> 1. Add an "Edit" button to `MovieCard.tsx` and `SeriesCard.tsx` that only appears if `localStorage.getItem("teleflix_user") === "zeeshan"`.
> 2. In `rankings.tsx`, fix the `useMemo` filter for `completedMedia`. If an item's ID from `getCompletedMedia()` is not found in `itemsMap`, show a placeholder instead of hiding the row.
> 3. Update the `MovieCard` and `SeriesCard` components to prioritize `movie.customTitle` and `movie.customPoster` from the JSON data.
> 
> 

These changes will ensure your 5 tracked rankings become visible and you gain the manual control you need over the metadata.
